## Requirements
All of our Python exercises require the following dependencies to be installed and configured:

* Python (version 3.8 or higher)
* Pytest (version 6.0 or higher)

## Installation
Please ensure that your Python version meets our expectations:
```bash
python --version
```

If you have an older version, please update Python by following the instructions here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Pytest
Please ensure that your Pytest version meets our expecations:
```bash
pytest --version
```

If you have an older version, please update Pytest by following the instructions here:

## Validation
You can validate your setup by navigating to the `setup` folder and running:
```
pytest .
```

### Raw output:
```
